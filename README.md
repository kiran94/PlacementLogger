# PlacementLogger
Project to help log day to day life on my university placement. 

As part of my placement year in industry I am required by my university to produce a report which will be graded. It was adviced to log my daily activities and so I am developing a web application which will aid me in this. 

The web application will be mobile friendly meaning that I can write up daily reports whilst on the go. The application will provide functionality to add new logs and then view them all.
